This Cataclysm Scripts are working with the most Cataclysm EMU´s
(Currently they are Developed with TrilliumEMU (4.2a Scripts) and ArkCore (4.06a Scripts) )

Some of this Repo Scripts are only fixed by me, not coded!
If i forgot to mention you in the credit list don`t hesitate to contact me.

The Repo is open for every Dev.
But if you use a Script it would be nice if you commit your
own fixes of my Scripts to this Repo.
